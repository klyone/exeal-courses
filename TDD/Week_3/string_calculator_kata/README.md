# Leap year kata

The goal of this kata is to implement a string calculator that is able to sum integer numbers.
The concrete rules are the following ones:

- Step 1: 0, 1 or 2 numbers separated by commas. The empty string returns the 0 value -> Function signature: int Add(String numbers)

- Step 2: Add can receive any amount of integers inside the string.

- Step 3: Include \n as default separator.

- Step 4: Custom user separator (format: //<sep>\n)

- Step 5: Avoid negative numbers (exception, no possible in C)

- Step 6: Ignore numbers higher than 1000

- Step 7: Include multi-char separator (format: //[delimiter]\n)

- Step 8: Multiple custom separators (format: //[delimiter1][delimiter2]\n)
