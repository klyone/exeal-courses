# Leap year kata

The goal of this kata is to check if a specific year is a leap one or not.
The concrete rules are the following ones:

- A leap year is divisible by 400
- A year that is divisible by 100 but not by 400 is NOT a leap year
- A year that is divisible by 4 but not by 100 is a leap year
- A year that is not divisible by 4 is NOT a leap year
